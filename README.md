This program uses real time data from [this NOAA Data Buoy](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=44090&uom=E&tz=STN), stationed in the middle of the Cape Cod Bay, to compose a long form piece of music based on the weather events that have transpired.

I used a novel method to map the cardinal directions of the wind, swells and wind waves to the circle of fifths, allowing the instruments in the piece to remain in a tonal context. This follows the paradigm that data sonification should use the data to control musical structures, instead of generating raw audio.

## Requirements

You'll need [JSyn](http://www.softsynth.com/jsyn/index.php) and [JMSL](http://www.algomusic.com/jmsl/jmslhome.html). JMSL is non-free, but has a 30 day trial license.
